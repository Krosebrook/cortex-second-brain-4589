# Security Audit Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the security posture of the Tessa AI Platform, including implemented security measures, identified vulnerabilities, and recommendations for improvement.

**Audit Date:** 2025-01-21 (Updated)  
**Platform Version:** 1.0.0  
**Status:** ✅ Critical Blockers Resolved - Ready for Final Review

---

## 1. Authentication & Authorization

### ✅ Implemented
- **Supabase Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with secure token management
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Database-level access control policies
- **Session Management**: Automatic session refresh and expiration handling
- **Multi-Factor Authentication Support**: MFA capabilities available through Supabase
- **OAuth Integration**: Google Drive OAuth flow implemented securely

### ⚠️ Identified Issues
- **Session Timeout**: Default session timeout may be too long for sensitive operations
- **Token Storage**: Access tokens stored in localStorage (consider HttpOnly cookies)

### 🔧 Recommendations
1. Implement shorter session timeout for admin operations (15 minutes)
2. Add session activity monitoring and automatic logout on suspicious activity
3. Consider migrating to HttpOnly cookies for token storage
4. Implement device fingerprinting for session validation

## 2. API Security

### ✅ Implemented
- **Rate Limiting**: Database-backed rate limiting for chat API (100 requests/10 min)
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper CORS headers configured for edge functions
- **Input Validation**: Request validation in edge functions
- **Authentication Required**: All sensitive endpoints require valid JWT

### ⚠️ Identified Issues
- **API Key Exposure**: No API key rotation mechanism
- **Request Size Limits**: Missing explicit request size limits
- **DDoS Protection**: Limited protection against distributed attacks

### 🔧 Recommendations
1. Implement API key rotation every 90 days

- **Audit Logging Service**: Comprehensive audit logging for sensitive operations

### ⚠️ Identified Issues
- **PII Handling**: No explicit PII classification or handling procedures
- **Data Retention**: No automated data retention policy
- **Backup Encryption**: Backup encryption status unclear

### 🔧 Recommendations
1. Implement PII classification and handling procedures
2. Add automated data retention policies (e.g., delete after 2 years)
3. Verify backup encryption is enabled
4. Implement data loss prevention (DLP) rules
5. Add GDPR/CCPA compliance tooling

---

## 4. Row-Level Security (RLS) Policies

### ✅ Implemented Policies

#### profiles table
```sql
-- Users can view their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile"
  ON profiles FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Users can update their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile"
  ON profiles FOR UPDATE
  USING (auth.uid() = id);
```

#### chats table
```sql
-- Users can only access their own chats
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own chats"
  ON chats FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Users can create their own chats
CREATE POLICY "Users can create chats"
  ON chats FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Users can update their own chats
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own chats"
  ON chats FOR UPDATE
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Users can delete their own chats
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own chats"
  ON chats FOR DELETE
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

#### knowledge_items table
```sql
-- Similar policies as chats table
-- Users can only access their own knowledge items
```

#### audit_logs table
```sql
-- Only admins can view audit logs
CREATE POLICY "Admins can view audit logs"
  ON audit_logs FOR SELECT
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM profiles
      WHERE id = auth.uid()
      AND role = 'admin'
    )
  );

-- System can insert audit logs
CREATE POLICY "System can insert audit logs"
  ON audit_logs FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (true);
```

### ⚠️ Identified Issues
- **Missing Policies**: Some tables may lack complete RLS policies
- **Performance**: Complex RLS policies may impact query performance
- **Testing**: Limited automated testing of RLS policies

### 🔧 Recommendations
