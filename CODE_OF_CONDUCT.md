## Introduction

### Purpose

This Code of Conduct establishes the behavioral standards and expectations for all participants in the Tessa AI Platform community. It serves as a foundational document that guides our interactions, promotes a culture of respect, and ensures a safe, welcoming environment for everyone.

### Scope of Application

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces associated with this project, including but not limited to:

- GitHub repositories (issues, pull requests, discussions, wikis)
- Official communication channels (Discord, Slack, forums)
- Social media accounts representing the project
- In-person and virtual events, meetups, and conferences
- Private communications when representing the project

### Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

We are committed to building a community that reflects the diversity of the global developer ecosystem. We believe that diverse perspectives lead to better software, stronger communities, and more innovative solutions. Our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) is not merely aspirational—it is woven into every aspect of how we operate.

We actively work to:

- Remove barriers to participation for underrepresented groups
- Amplify diverse voices and perspectives in decision-making
- Provide equitable access to resources, mentorship, and opportunities
- Continuously educate ourselves on inclusive practices
- Hold ourselves accountable for creating lasting, positive change

For more information on our DEI initiatives, please refer to our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Community Resources](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
